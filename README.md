# CNN-for-differentiating-between-pets-Cats-and-Dogs-
This Repo is for object classification and detection coding practice. A simple dataset having 2 classes (10,000 images in total) is used to build different CNN architectures such as:

 - Simple CNN
 - Residual Networks (50 Layers)
 - VGG19
 - Inception Network
 - AlexNet

I particularly wanted to experiment with image preprocessing and the keras library. Some of the models will be trained on datasets having more classes (CIFAR 100, Caltech 256, etc.)
